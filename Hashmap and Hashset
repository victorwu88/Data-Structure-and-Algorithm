Leetcode 249: 
Given an array of strings (all lowercase letters), the task is to group them in such a way that all strings in a group are shifted versions of each other. Two string S and T are called shifted if, 
S.length = T.length 
and
S[i] = T[i] + K for 
1 <= i <= S.length  for a constant integer K
For example strings, {acd, dfg, wyz, yab, mop} are shifted versions of each other.
Input  : str[] = {"acd", "dfg", "wyz", "yab", "mop",
                 "bdfh", "a", "x", "moqs"};
Output : a x
         acd dfg wyz yab mop
         bdfh moqs
All shifted strings are grouped together.
Intuition:
We can see a pattern among the string of one group, the difference between consecutive characters for all character of the string are equal. As in the above example take acd, dfg and mop
a c d -> 2 1 
d f g -> 2 1 
m o p -> 2 1
Since the differences are the same, we can use this to identify strings that belong to the same group. The idea is to form a string of differences as key. If a string with the same difference string is found, then this string also belongs to the same group. For example, the above three strings have the same difference string, which is “21”. 
In the below implementation, we add ‘a’ to every difference and store 21 as “ba”.
